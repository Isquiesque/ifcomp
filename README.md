======

_The software behind the Interactive Fiction Competition. (Sort of.)_

This repository contains a project very much under active construction. Eventually it will power ifcomp.org (replacing what's there now, albeit towards the same goals). Today, however, it can't even blow its own nose.

More details here, once the thing's in such a state as to deserve 'em.
